<h2>Some Proposed Projects</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Bokeh(Depth of field) effect with a single camera: </b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh">link </a>Now a days lot of mobile camera have are giving "portrait mode" as they call it to generate synthetic depth of field effect but this is gnerally done using dual camera design. Your challenge is to do it using single camera image.
<li><b>Evaluating handwritten mathematical expressions:</b> Scanning handwritten equations and expression and evaluate them.
<li><b>Vehicle registration plate(Indian Version) detection and recognition:</b> Automated pipeline to acquire registration plate from images of vehicle and do OCR on them.
<li><b>Plane extraction on surfaces:</b> Track a section of a plane so that a user can place an 3D object on the surface, for augmented reality applications.
<li><b>Glyph based AR application:</b> <img src="glyphs_sample.png"> Images above depict typical glyphs, You job is to develop an appication which tracks these glyphs, computes homography and overlays 3D graphics over it as in typical AR application.
<li><b>Barrel distortion estimation and removal:</b> 
<li><b>Tracking objects using mean shift:</b> Associated paper <a href="http://comaniciu.net/Papers/MsTracking.pdf">link</a>
<li><b>Simulating depth of field using stereo images:</b> Same as 1 but this time you have pair of sterio images, get the dataset from here <a href="http://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/2014/">link</a>
<li><b>Street sign translation:</b> Taking images of street signs and translating the text, as found in Google goggles, translate or World Lens(now defunct).
<li><b>Face detection using CNN:</b> Creating and training CNN model to output bounding box for faces in images.
<li><b>Whale recognition (Kaggle Challenge):</b> Take a look at this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-right-whale-recognition">link</a>
